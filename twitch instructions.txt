I am available May 15th and on, from 9AM-5PM PST.

NOTE: At the moment, only http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:8080 are valid base URLs.

For ease of use, you can use the provided "server.js" for testing and "buttons.json" for pre-made buttons.

Configuration:
1. Go to either the live config in the Stream Manager or the Extension config page.
2. Follow the fields to customize the buttons to your liking.
3. For URL and method, it helps if you have an endpoint to test. (ex. URL: "http://localhost:3000/yourendpoint", method: GET)
4. To visualize what the stream will look like, click in the blue area where the buttons get created to upload an image.
5. For additional customization, fill out the css field. Example input: "attribute1": "value1", "attribute2" : "value2", etc.

Using the extension:
6. Once done, make sure the stream is live and active the extension.
7. Clicking the button will send the info the the endpoint specified.
8. If you want to change something about the button on click, the buttons expect in response the attributes you would like to change. It is easy to do this by simply modifying the data you receive at the endpoint.
9. You can also send a PubSub request with the buttons you want to modify. IDs of the buttons are found on the config screen. The payload should be as follows:
message = {
    .
    .
    .
    data = [
        { id: <id of the button you want to modify>, 
            attributes you want to change
        },
        { id: <id of the button you want to modify>, 
            attributes you want to change
        }, ...
    ]
}

This is useful for resetting buttons, for example.
